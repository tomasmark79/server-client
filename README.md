# server-client

is simple C++ eNet implementation. eNet is Server/Client UDP low latency network library.

All the magic is in one header file named network.h.
Some example calls which can be helpful for your fast start are in main.cpp.

From the reason this solution is very useful it will probably updated continuously. 
Enjoy.
