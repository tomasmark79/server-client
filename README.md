# server-client

My simple C++ eNet implementation for my own projects. eNet is useful Server/Client UDP transport interface.

My implementation is useful Server/Client header file, which is helpful to transfer some types across network environment. For you fast start you can use an examples from main.cpp.

Header Network.h shall be updated as neccessary.

Enjoy.
